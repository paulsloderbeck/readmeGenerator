### Description
This is a readme generator created using node and the inquirer package. It takes the user through a seris of Command Line Prompts to get a description of his or her project. It then uses template literals from the answers object to populate a markdown file for a good readme, finally writing the readme to the machine using an Async writefile command in node.
### Installation
The generator can be cloned and pullled from github.
### Usage
The generator should be used in the command line, and will generate the readme file in markdown.
### Contributing
Please contribute to the community and make any suggestions you have!
### Tests

### License
This application features a MIT license.
